# Derek Berrey — Solutions Engineering Portfolio
Welcome! This is a collection of small projects I’ve built to showcase my technical problem-solving skills, business acumen, and ability to translate between technical and non-technical audiences. 
My background is in SaaS sales, and I’m currently transitioning into solutions engineering roles where I can combine my customer-facing experience with technical execution.
